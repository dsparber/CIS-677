\subsection*{Part b - Randomized algorithm}

\subsubsection*{Claim}

The expected number of the leaves queried by the algorithm on any instance is at most $n^{0.9}$.

\subsection*{Proof}

Let $T$ be arbitrary, let $h \geq 1$ be arbitrary. Assume $h$ is the height of tree $T$.

Let $X_h$ be the number of leaves queried by the algorithm for the tree T with height $h \geq 1$.

Let $p_a$ be the probability, that two values chosen uniformly at random have the same value.

Two sub trees need to be evaluated. If the values disagree, the third sub tree needs to be evaluated. 

The cost of evaluating a leaf is 1. The cost of evaluating an inner node $v$ is equal to evaluating the sub tree with root $v$. Thus evaluating a tree with height $h - 1$.

Therefore, he expected value can be defined recursively as following:

$\EV[X_1] = 
p_a \cdot 2 \cdot 1 + (1 - p_a) \cdot 3 \cdot 1 =
(3 - p_a)$

$\EV[X_h] = 
p_a \cdot 2 \cdot \EV[X_{h - 1}] + (1 - p_a) \cdot 3 \cdot \EV[X_{h - 1}] =
(3 - p_a) \cdot \EV[X_{h-1}]
$

Any inner node of T has either three children with the same value or two children with one value and one child with the other value.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Case 1: Node has different child values
    
    To get two agreeing values, the first and the second child need to have the same value, i.e.:
    
    $p_a = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{3}$
    
    \item Case 2: Node has same child values
    
    No matter which two children are chosen, the value always agrees, thus: 
    
    $p_a = 1$
    
\end{itemize}

Thus $p_a \geq \frac{1}{3}$, and therefore:

$\EV[X_1] \leq
(3 - \frac{1}{3}) = \frac{8}{3}$

$\EV[X_h] \leq 
(3 - \frac{1}{3}) \cdot \EV[X_{h-1}] = 
\frac{8}{3} \cdot \EV[X_{h-1}]$

\textit{Lemma:}
$\forall h \geq 1: \EV[X_h] \leq \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^h$

Proof by induction over $h$.

Induction hypothesis IH: $\EV[X_h] \leq \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^h$

Let $h \geq 1$ be arbitrary.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Case $h = 1$:
    
    $\EV[X_1] \leq \frac{8}{3} = \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^1$
    
    \item Case $h \geq 1$:
    
    $\EV[X_h] \leq 
    \frac{8}{3} \cdot \EV[X_{h-1}] = 
    \frac{8}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^{h-1} = 
    \left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^h$
    
\end{itemize}

Thus, IH holds.

By applying \textit{Lemma}:

$\EV[X_h] \leq 
\left(\frac{8}{3}\right)^h \leq
(3^{0.9})^h =
(3^h)^{0.9} = 
n^{0.9}$
