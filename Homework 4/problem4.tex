\section*{Problem 4}

We define an arbitrary node $c \in V$ as center node.

$E' = \{\{c, v\} ~|~ v \in V\}$

$E'$ contains exactly $n$ edges by construction, thus fulfilling the requirement of the task.

The diameter of $G'(V, E \cup E')$ is bounded by $2$ since, for any $u, v \in V$, $u \rightarrow c \rightarrow v$ is a valid path in $G'$ of length $2$.

$G$ is connected, therefore $m \geq n - 1$. Furthermore, $|E'| \in \bigO(n) \subseteq \bigO(m)$ and $|E| = m$. The total number of edges $|E \cup E'|$ is therefore in $\bigO(m)$.

\textit{Corollary form lecture:} In an undirected graph with diameter $D$, the cover time is bound by $\bigO(mD\log n)$.

By invoking the corollary we get a cover time of $\bigO(m 2 \log n) = \bigO(m \log n)$.
